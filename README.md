*Today marked the start of my new journey as a college student, and the day began with a special ardas at the Gurudwara Sahib on the college campus. It was a very moving and powerful experience to receive the blessings before embarking on this new chapter of my life. The day was then filled with various activities conducted by alumni of the college, who shared their insights and experiences with us. It was a delightful way to get to know some of the people who have come before me and to learn from their wisdom. Overall, it was a wonderful start to my college career, and I am excited to see what the future holds!*

*Today we had a maths class with Mam Sandeep. Her class was engaging and smooth. I made a silly mistake in a solution, and she didn't react negatively at all. Instead, she told me to take another look and figure it out, which I appreciate. Her personality is so welcoming and approachable, which made me feel relaxed in class. Her openness to questions and her willingness to help out make her a great teacher.*

 *Our coding class with the sir was a truly memorable experience. His enthusiasm and knowledge made the entire class engaging and interactive. We were all thrilled to learn about the intricacies of using Github, and the sir's clear explanations and hands-on demonstrations made the concept seem much less daunting. Sir gave a comprehensive yet clear and concise introduction to the platform, and we all felt much more confident in our understanding of it by the end of the class. It was a wonderful day, filled with learning, discovery, and camaraderie.*
